Hello! I’m a student at the **University of California, Berkeley** studying **Computer Science** and **Data Science** with an emphasis in **Robotics**.

Previously, I worked at **Google** as a Software Engineering Intern on the Google Meet Infrastructure team, where I contributed to developing scalable backend systems. I also interned at **ZoomInfo** as a Machine Learning Engineer, where I built and optimized Natural Language Processing pipelines.

In addition, I conducted academic research at **[LM-Arena](https://lmarena.ai/)** under **Tim Li**, working on Arena-Hard-Auto, where I focused on post-model evaluation and designing more efficient evaluation algorithms.

I’m deeply interested in exploring diverse and challenging problems — always looking for what’s next!
